# USER ACTIONS

# LEFT / RIGHT
# * LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified 
# direction without changing the position of the robot.
# * A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, 
# LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.

# REPORT
# * REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in 
# any form, but standard output is sufficient.
# * A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, 
# LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.

# PLACE X,Y,F
# * PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and 
# facing NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
# * The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most 
# corner. <â€” i.e. bottom left
# * The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after 
# that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, 
# including another PLACE command. The application should discard 
# all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been 
# executed.

# MOVE
# * MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction 
# it is currently facing.
# * A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, 
# LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.
